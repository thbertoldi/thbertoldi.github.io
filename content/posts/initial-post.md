Hi there! My name is Thiago, and this blog is dedicated to IoT Software Development, from the embedded systems to the cloud. Hope you guys enjoy my insights on this subject!

Before anything else, let me talk a little bit about myself. I'm a Control and Automation Engineer, and I have been working with IoT systems ever since 2015, when I first entered a research lab at UFSC.

Today, my go-to languages are Go and Python, so most of my examples will be developed in one of those two languages!

Well, I really love Wireless Networks and Connectivity subjects. On future posts, I expect to talk about IoT projects, Embedded Linux stuff and Wireless Networks, of course!

If you got to this point, thanks a lot! Hope you'll enjoy my posts!
